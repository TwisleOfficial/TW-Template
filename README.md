# 📝 TW-TEMPLATE

### 🧠 About
Honestly I made this so I could have a place to always get a template file for my scripts with all the framework stuff in one place so my scripts can support multiple frameworks. After everyone one stream wanted it I made the repo public so yall could use it. If you want to help with this repo go ahead and make a PR only thing I ask is that you dont do anything to crazy or make to many changes the other reason for this repo if for me to learn ESX better lol.

### 🖥️ Install
